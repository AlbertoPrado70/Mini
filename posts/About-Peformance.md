# Allmost all websites have performance issues
  
Last week I’ve been very busy working on websites for these clients:

  * [https://mueblesalex.com](https://mueblesalex.com/)
  * [https://tiendasoseltexcoco.com](https://tiendasoseltexcoco.com/)
  * <https://contadorresico.com.mx>
  * [https://www.meneses.law/](https://www.meneses.law/es)

All of them reached out to me through my website ([alprado.com](https://alprado.com/)), and they all have something in common: performance issues.

  


Throughout my career as a web developer, I’ve noticed something important: performance is probably the most crucial factor in a website.

  


And although I like websites built with GSAP or Three.js, I believe it’s not worth adding those flashy animations if they affect the site’s performance.

  


Right now, I’m working on a redesign for my own website, and one of my main goals is to properly combine animations with exceptional performance.
